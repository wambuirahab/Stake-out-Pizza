2. A user has an option for delivery and the price for delivery is shown.
3. Once a user has opted for the delivery option,he/she is prompted to enter their location and is alerted the pizza will be delivered in that location on checkout.
4. Upon Checkout, the customer is able to see the summary of all the orders they placed with their respective prices and finally the grand total charge.
